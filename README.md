# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Ash. I am a student in Mobile/Web Application Development seeking my associates degree. I have been a hairstylist for the last 10 years and I'm excited to switch gears and pursue a career in Technology. I'm a single mom with three children and a Mini Australian Shepherd. I have severe wanderlust and a major love for hiking and the Pacific Northwest.
